# SpearGameLibrary
## Project Description
Provide a high-level description of what the completed project does, what it consists of, and any other information needed to understand it.

The final version of our project consists of over 20 levels. This also includes our fully built out navigation screens and help screens with professor spear’s original text. We also have a scrollable level select screen allowing users to pick which level to start with. Concepts explored in the newer levels include invincibility and strength for the hero, picking up goodies, as well as friction and elasticity balls. The project also includes some demo levels utilizing the Forge2D physics engine.


## Key Processes or Procedures
List all necessary instructions for carrying out key processes, such as updating a web site, backing up a database, getting approval from the app store for a mobile application, building a compiled application, etc.

The newest version of the Flutter framework that we used to build this project makes compiling and running our project significantly easier. Prior to the update, it was necessary to download Android development tools, which came with an android emulator to be run through VSCode. Now, by opening the project on your local computer in VSCode and after downloading the necessary plugins through the editor, you can simply select run with debugging and it will give you the option to either run the application through an emulator, a process that can take a few minutes for the first time it’s being run, or through google chrome, which is much faster and easier. 


## Technologies/Tools
Summarize the technical components of your project and what roles they play.  (Programming languages, IDEs, databases, data-access components, etc.)

Outside of Git for version control, our project only uses a few different technologies that our group had to become accustomed to. The two major technologies are the Dart programming language, and it’s corresponding framework, Flutter. Both are used by Google when designing mobile applications and have a relatively large and growing following online. The final technology we’ve become accustomed to is the Flame game engine, which is a library for Flutter used specifically for creating games. The final portion of the project also saw the group explore the Forge2D physics engine and create some separate demo levels utilizing this library. 



## Challenges/Learnings
List significant challenges encountered, and how you addressed them.. List other key project learnings.

Some of the bigger challenges that we ran into as a group was implementing a project with a current version of Flutter, while still being able to use a previous version of Flame. Many of the tutorials on the Flame game engine were extremely outdated and new iterations of the language had since been made that no longer used syntax in the tutorials. We found a relatively recent version of Flame and then stayed with that version, while continuing to update Flutter when needed. We also ran into issues when attempting to code some of the physics ourselves before discovering the Forge2D physics engine. One of the biggest things we learned has to do with software development as a whole, in that while the end behavior is important, the process to get there through the high level architecture is even more so.
